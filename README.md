# CLIPnP

A command-line interface for UPnP (Universal Plug 'n' Play), made with Java. 
If you've ever been interested in hosting a minecraft server or ever needed to configure port forwarding on your router,
you're in luck! This lightweight Java command-line interface can automatically port-forward for you, with just a single command.

Just run the program, and type "help" for a brief overview of the commands and their functionality.
If you're interested in automating the process, or have a ton of ports you have to type in every time,
or you want the program to save your configuration on restarts, then look no further! With the simple built-in
JSON configuration manager, you can easily export and import configurations from a file.

To save your config on restarts, add a filepath into your command-line argument when launching the program, pointing
to the config file. Create new config files, mix them together, and save them, all with simple commands.
